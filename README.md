## Building

### Pre-Requisites

The program is written in standard C++14 standards and requires a C++ compiler (`gcc`, `clang` etc.).
Following are the pre-requisites to building:

```
* A C++ compiler
* Make
* CMake (Preferred)
```

### Building

The complete code for the LRU and clock are given as header files for easy and convinient use.
The library can be utilized simply by copy-pasting into your personal project. Here are the 
instructions to run `benchmarks`

1. Create a build folder
```
$ cd benchmarks
$ mkdir build && cd build
```

2. Invoke cmake
```
$ cmake ..
```

3. Build files
```
$ make
```

If you have done the setup right, you should see 4 executables `lru_aging`, `lru_counter`,
`lru_stack` and `clock`. To run, simply execute the executable:

```
$ ./lru_counter
```

**Note:** In case you do not have Cmake installed, you can use a fallback makefile option.
To get the above executables, simply run the *Makefile* provided in the *benchmarks* folder.

```
$ cd benchmarks
$ make
```
